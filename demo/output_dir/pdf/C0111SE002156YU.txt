HOMOCYSTEINE, SERUM/PLASMA

HOMOCYSTEINE 16.37 High With folate umol/L
supplementation < 12
Without folate
supplementation < 15
METHOD : CHEMILUMINESCENCE,COMPETITIVE IMMUNOASSAY

Interpretation(s)

HOMOCYSTEINE, SERUM/PLASMA-Homocysteine is an intermediary in the sulfur-amino acid metabolism pathways, linking the methionine cycle to the folate cycle. Inborn
errors of metabolism that lead to homocysteinemia or homocysteinuria include cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency and various defects of methionine re-methylation.
Genetic defects in vitamin cofactors (vitamin B6, B12, and folate) and nutritional deficiency of B12 and folate also lead to abnormal homocysteine accumulation. As
Homocysteine is an indicator of acquired Folate or Vitamin B 12 deficiency, serum Folic acid or Vitamin B12 deficiency should be ruled out in case of abnormal homocysteine
level.

Other factors that may influence and increase plasma homocysteine include:
Age, Smoking, poor diet/cofactor deficiencies, Chronic kidney disease/renal disease & Hypothyroidism

A high level of homocysteine makes a person more prone to endothelial injury, which leads to vascular inflammation, which in turn may lead to atherogenesis, which can

result in ischemic injury. Abnormally high levels of homocysteine in the serum, above 15 umol/L, is a medical condition called hyperhomocysteinimia which has been claimed

to be a significant risk factor for the development of a wide range of diseases, include thrombosis, neuropsychiatric illness, and fractures.
Patients taking methotrexate, nicotinic acid, Theophylline, nitrous oxide, S-adenosyl-methionine and L-dopa can have falsely elevated serum HCY levels.

Heterophilic antibodies in human serum can react with reagent immunoglobulins, interfering with in vitro immunoassays. Patients routinely exposed to animals or to animal
serum products can be prone to this interference and anomalous values may be observed.
